### Design pattern practice task #3

---

The goal of this task is to change the code to meet the performance requirements. 

You **DO NOT** need to change the output of the code or change the functionality.

You **NEED** to refactor the code.

Comments will indicate whether a class or method is allowed to be changed or not.

Requirements:

- Refactor the code to use a _fitting_ design pattern!
- Do not change functionality!
- Feel free to add and remove files based on the rules specified earlier.
- You can run the `src/main/java/org/example/Application.java` to test your solution.
- If you run the app you will see this exception: `java.lang.RuntimeException: The app is too slow! It took 10349ms to run but the limit is: 10000ms`. Your job is to get rid of this exception by refactoring the code.
